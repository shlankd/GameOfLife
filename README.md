The Game of Life is a simulation game developed by mathematician John Conway as a model for studying the life cycle of living organisms.
The game is played on a giant matrix whose elements constitute possible sites of existence: each site can have one of the following two states:
A. "There is life" - a full site of existence - marked as a full square
B. "There is no life" - an empty site of existence - marked as an empty square
CONWAY's basic laws of genetics:
• Birth - at every site where "there is no life" and has exactly 3 living neighbors, there will be a birth in the next generation. Otherwise, the site remains "without life" - empty.
• Death - at every site where "there is life" and has 0 or 1 living neighbors, death will occur in the next generation as a result of isolation. 
          At every site where "there is life" and has 4 or more living neighbors, death will occur in the next generation as a result of a "population explosion".
• Existence - every site where "there is life" and has 2 or 3 living neighbors will continue to exist in the next generation.
              The processes of birth, death, and existence occur simultaneously at all sites, creating a new state of life called a new generation.
